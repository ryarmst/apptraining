    "description": "The intent of this lab is to practice JavaScript analysis and automation of client-side functionality. The client-side code in this scenario modifies input data before sending it to the server. There are two tasks to complete. First, identify a quick way to inject arbitrary data into the field. Next identify an approach that will allow you to use Burp's scanner against the input pre-encoded, ensuring scan payloads are ultimately encoded properly and parsed by the server.",
