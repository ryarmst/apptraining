# JavaScript Analysis Lab

This is a training exercise for application security testers to practice JavaScript analysis and browser developer tools usage. The application implements a "secure" input processor with client-side validation and transformation.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Challenge

The goal is to analyze the client-side JavaScript code and understand:
1. How the input validation works
2. What transformations are applied to the input
3. How the data is sent to the server
4. What processing happens on the server side
5. Potential security vulnerabilities in the implementation

### Hints
- Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests
- Analyze the JavaScript code transformation functions
- Look for ways to bypass client-side validation
- Consider what happens to the transformed data on the server

## Security Notes

This application is intentionally designed with certain security flaws for educational purposes. Do not use any of this code in a production environment.
